      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="me.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Clara Ayala Garcia, my friends would describe me as easy going, thoughtful, and hardworking. I enjoy painting classes,
         taking my four year old son on advantures during my free time, and trying new food in Richmond.</p>

      <p>My current major is Computer Science because I enjoy learning the concepts of algorithms, programming languages, 
        program design, software and hardware. During my high school years math was always my favorite subject to learn and decided 
        that Computer Science was a lot less repetitive and entertaining than teaching math.</p>

      <p>While i work on my Computer Science degree I decided to do the programming boot camp to get my foot in the door on what I wanted to 
        make my career. I really enjoyed collaborating with my classmates, showing off my newly learned skills, and figuring out how to get past 
        all the bugs. I aquired a wealth of knowledge during the course and have many projects to show for it.</p>
